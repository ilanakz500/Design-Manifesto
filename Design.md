## Design Manifesto üìù
This design Manifesto acts as a reflection for my time in [CS 3041: Human-Computer Interaction](https://cs3041-18d.github.io/).

When I began CS 3041, I had never taken any design-based courses before and design was not something that I frequently thought about. What I learned in this course goes far beyond technologies like JavaScript, Affectiva, FlowXo, etc. I learned how to navigate the design-process to create a strong final product, regardless of the technology in use. 
 
### The Design Process
What I discovered through this course, is that above all, sticking to the design process is integral. Without it, your team quickly becomes lost and unfocused. I also learned that the design process is moldable, and changes based on the scope of your projecct as well as the available time-frame. 

### Brainstorming
Brainstorming is arguably the most important step of the design process. It is important to brainstorm any and all possible ideas that come to mind, even if they seem too ambitious, too simple, or too unrelated. My group for Design for Tension did a great job at brainstorming.

We were able to brainstorm over 15 possible topics for our chatbot to debate and then narrow down to three (highlighted) choices. 

### Expectations versus Reality
Looking back on the course, I now understand that acknowledging your own and your team's limitations as well as the limitations of the available technologies prior to beginning a project is an important step in delivering a successful project.

In my Design for Wellbeing group, our aim was to create an educational and interactive model of the Solar System. However, due to our limited knowledge of A-Frame we were only able to deliver on half of our goal. Something we were planning on incorporating was for the user to be able to click on any planet and for a small drop down window to appear, providing the user with information on the planet. However, we were unable to implement this into our code. 

For a demo of our final project click **[here](http://users.wpi.edu/~mbosik/AnotherWorld/)**. 

Lastly, time is another important aspect in understanding the limitations of your project. Given more time in our Design for Another World project, we would have been able to do more calculations in order to scale the planets properly. 

### Feedback
Test, test, test. I wish I had understood the importance of conducting vigorous testing before, during, and after implementation of your prototype. You may design what seems to be a seamless product, with tons of functionality, but if this product poses no benefit to your target demographic, than it becomes useless. 
While many of the projects I worked on produced visually appealing deliverables, my team did not understand our target demographic well enough to deliver a 100% useful product. 

**User Research**

When working on the Design for Others project, my team made sure to do a lot of research on our target demographic: Toursits. We looked at webpages and mobile applications that were designed specifically for tourists, to see what functionalities were available. Additionally, we created a moodboard containing a select set of fonts, colors, and styles to set the tone for our design that we would use during development.

For this project, we were able to deliver a successful prototype of an mobile app of the Worcester Public Library, designed specifically for tourists. 
Below are the Home and Events pages for the app.

We chose to include an 'Emergency' page because we are assuming the tourists are foreign to either Massuchusetts and/or the United States, so they may not know how to contact emergency services or about specific health & safety resources available near Worcester.
Without conducting an extensive study of our target demographic, we would have missed certain aspects of the design such as having the option to select a language on the Home page. 
However, more testing can always be done. With a bit more time on our hands, it would be very useful to interview real tourists travelling in the Worcester area to ask them what they expect to see from a Public Library application. In addition, testing the prototype is extremely helpful to designers. During the demo-day in class we received many useful suggestions on our app design such as adding a page for checking out books and editing the layout of our Events page to be more user-friendly. Without user feedback like this, delpoying our app to the market may result in a failed venture. 

**Wizard of Oz Testing**

My group for Design for Tension employed Wizard of Oz testing when creating our chatbot.


### Challenges
One of the challenges that arguably all of my groups faced was a lack of communication. This was most evident in my Design for Understanding group. After brainstorming and settling on our final designs, we all went our separate ways to code the project and there was little to no communication until the last day of the project. The day before the project was due, one of the group members messaged our group the following message: 
> "Okay, this project is due tomorrow and I don't know what we have done. Can you guys post whatever you have finished for the demo here?"

This lack of communication resulted in our delivery of an inconsistent and disjoint final project.
