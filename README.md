I am a sophomore Management Information Systems major with minors in Computer Science and Data Science. This class acts as my minor capstone for CS. This Summer, I will be working as a Data Analytics intern at MAPFRE Insurance. After graduation, I hope to go into a career in either Data Analytics or User Experience & Decision Making. In either field, I hope to focus heavily on creating user-centric products and enhancing human interaction with machines.
