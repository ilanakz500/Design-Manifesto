## Design Manifesto
When I began CS 3041, I had never taken any design-based courses before and design was not something that I frequently thought about. What I learned in this course goes far beyond technologies like JavaScript, Affectiva, FlowXo, etc. I learned how to navigate the design-process to create a final product, regardless of the technology in use. 
 
### The Design Process
What I discovered through this course, is that above all, sticking to the design process is integral. Without it, your team quickly becomes lost and unfocused. 

### Expectations versus Reality
Looking back on the course, I know understand that acknowledging your own and your team's limitations prior to beginning a project is an important step to delivering a successful project. Both the Design for Tension and the Design for Wellbeing projects required knowledge of JS for the deliverable; however, my project team for Design for Wellbeing had a much greater combined knowledge of JS than my group for Design for Understanding. 

Additionally, understanding the available technologies 

Lastly, time is another important aspect in understanding the limitations of your project. 

### Challenges
Group communication

### Reflection

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ilanakz500/Design-Manifesto/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ilanakz500/Design-Manifesto/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
