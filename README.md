## Welcome to Ilana's Design Manifesto

### About Me

I am a Management Information Systems major with minors in Computer Science and Data Science. This class acts as my minor capstone for CS. 

### Projects/Portfolio
1. Airport App Design
2. Design for Others
3. Design for Understanding
4. Design for Tension
5. Design for Wellbeing
6. Design for Another World 

When I began CS 3041, I had never taken any design-based courses before and design was not something that I frequently thought about. What I learned in this course goes far beyond technologies like JavaScript, Affectiva, FlowXo, etc. I learned how to use the design-process to create a final product, regardless of the technology in use. 
 
## The Design Process

## Expectations vs Reality

## Challenges

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ilanakz500/Design-Manifesto/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ilanakz500/Design-Manifesto/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
