## Design Manifesto
When I began CS 3041, I had never taken any design-based courses before and design was not something that I frequently thought about. What I learned in this course goes far beyond technologies like JavaScript, Affectiva, FlowXo, etc. I learned how to navigate the design-process to create a final product, regardless of the technology in use. 
 
### The Design Process
What I discovered through this course, is that above all, sticking to the design process is integral. Without it, your team quickly becomes lost and unfocused. 

### Expectations versus Reality
Looking back on the course, I know understand that acknowledging your own and your team's limitations prior to beginning a project is an important step to delivering a successful project. Both the Design for Tension and the Design for Wellbeing projects required knowledge of JS for the deliverable; however, my project team for Design for Wellbeing had a much greater combined knowledge of JS than my group for Design for Understanding. 

Additionally, understanding the available technologies 

Lastly, time is another important aspect in understanding the limitations of your project. 

### User Testing
Test, test, test. I wish I had understood the importance of conducting vigorous
You may design what seems to be a seamless product, with tons of functionality, but if this product poses no benefit to your target demographic, than it becomes useless. 
While many of the projects I worked on produced visually appealing deliverables, my team did not understand our target demographic well enough to deliver a 100% useful product. 
When working on the Design for Others project, my team made sure to do a lot of research on our target demographic: Toursits. We looked at webpages and mobile applications that were designed specifically for tourists, to see what functionalities were available. 
In our Design for Others project, we were asked to design for tourists. 
For this project, we were able to deliver a successful prototype of an mobile app of the Worcester Public Library, designed specifically for tourists.

### Challenges
Group communication

### Reflection

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ilanakz500/Design-Manifesto/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ilanakz500/Design-Manifesto/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
