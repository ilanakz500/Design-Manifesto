1. [Good Design, Bad Design](https://medium.com/@ilanazeldin/wpi-design-in-action-85e33b8efcc0 "Good Design, Bad Design")

The purpose of this project was to identify elements of good and bad design at WPI. This proved more difficult than I thought, since after being on campus for 1.5 years, I had become accustomed to certain elements of 'bad design' because I interacted with them so frequently. This project made me view the world around me in a way I had never done before and made me really think about what maked a good design good or a bad design bad.
