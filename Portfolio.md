**[Good Design, Bad Design](https://medium.com/@ilanazeldin/wpi-design-in-action-85e33b8efcc0 "Good Design, Bad Design")**

The purpose of this project was to identify elements of good and bad design at WPI. This proved more difficult than I thought, since I had become accustomed to certain elements of 'bad design' after attending school here for over a year because I interacted with them so frequently. This project made me view the world around me in a way I had never done before and made me really think about what makes a good design good or a bad design bad. 

**[Design for Others](https://medium.com/@ilanazeldin/designing-for-tourists-816e20fdb741 "Design for Others")**

In this project, we were tasked to re-design the Worcester Public Library webpage for a target demographic: Tourists. This was my first look into the world of the design process and how to succesfully navigate the design process from ideation to completion. In order to be successful in our design, we had to conduct research into the needs of our target demographic and create a Moodboard to set the tone for our mobile design that included a set of fonts, colors, and styles that we would use during development. We used proto.io to complete our project and focused on creating an intuitive user-focused design.

**[Design for Understanding](https://medium.com/@ilanazeldin/design-for-understanding-39975b05bcea "Design for Understanding")**

Through this project, I was able to understand the powerful impact of data visualization and how data can be manipulated to tell a story. By choosing the proper visualization, a different message can be evoked, even if the data being used is the same. My group focused on a data set with information on the world's billionares. For our final project, we produced three graphs for understanding and one graph for persuasion, with the goal of swaying users to believe a specific story. 

**[Design for Tension](https://medium.com/@michaelbosik/design-for-tension-group-13-e49fcef641b2 "Design for Tension")**

This project aimed to introduce us to using chatbots in order to discuss a topic of tension with a user. Our group focused on creating a bot that discussed school uniforms and we made sure that the bot would be able to argue both sides of the argument. For this project, made sure to conduct wizard of oz testing prior to implementing our bot. Some constraints for this project included the fact that Facebook had periodically de-activated the use of chatbots for its platforms, so we were left with very limited options for implementation of our bot. This was one of my favorite projects in this course and I really enjoyed programming the bot and giving him a great personality.

**[Design for Wellbeing](https://medium.com/@ilanazeldin/design-for-wellbeing-7cc8d2f7a9a7 "Desing for Wellbeing")**

This project involved implementing Affectiva's libraries to gage users emotions and design a product that is beneficial for the user. My group implemented Affectiva to detect the user's joy response and determine if they were a cat person or a dog person. Then, we presented users with a list of benefits of being a dog-owner or a cat-owner, with the hopes of potentially increasing their overall welfare.

**Design for Another World** 

In this project, my team and I used Aframe to create a basic virtual-reality environment. We took the assignment literally and create another world: the universe. The purpose of this project was to introduce young children to an interactive model of the universe. Although it is not entirely to scale, the project can be expanded upon in the future to include proper (to scale) calculations as well as more interactive components such as basic planet information.
