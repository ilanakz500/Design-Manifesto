1. [Good Design, Bad Design](https://medium.com/@ilanazeldin/wpi-design-in-action-85e33b8efcc0 "Good Design, Bad Design")

The purpose of this project was to identify elements of good and bad design at WPI. This proved more difficult than I thought, since after being on campus for 1.5 years, I had become accustomed to certain elements of 'bad design' because I interacted with them so frequently. This project made me view the world around me in a way I had never done before and made me really think about what maked a good design good or a bad design bad. 

2. [Design for Others](https://medium.com/@ilanazeldin/designing-for-tourists-816e20fdb741 "Design for Others") 

In this project, we were tasked to re-design the Worcester Public Library webpage for a target demographic: Tourists. This was my first look into the world of the design process and how to succesfully navigate the design process from ideation to completion. In order to be successful in our design, we had to conduct research into the needs of our target demographic and create a Moodboard to set a tone for our mobile design that included a set of fonts, colors, and styles that we would use during development. We used proto.io to complete our project and make our prototype.
